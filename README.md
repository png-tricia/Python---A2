## PROG12583 Programming Foundations - Python: Assignment 2
Program: **Computer Programming @ Sheridan College** <br>
Note: The following assignment was completed during Semester 1 (2023) <br>

## The Task:
Create a program that calculate the sales commission earned by a Salesperson. <br> If the Salesperson sold $500 of desks, then the commission earned is $30. If the Salesperson sold $1000 of chairs and $400 of tables then the commission earned is $60 ($50 + $10). The rubric for this assignment had a table breakdown of how the commissions worked. 

## Details: 
<ul>
  <li>At startup, the program prompts the user to type in a Salesperson's ID, table sales, desks sales, and chair sales.</li>
  <li>If the user enters invalid data (such as negative chair sales then a message should appear stating: "Invalid: Enter valid chair sales: "
    <ul>
      <li>the program should not continue until the user enters valid data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the program then calculates the commission on the sales based on the table</li>
  <li>the program should then prompt the user whether to process another Salesperson
    <ul>
      <li>the process should be repeated until the user decides not to continue</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>once the user has decided not to enter another salesperson data, two tables should appear, a sales table and a commissions table</li>
  <li>the sales table displays on each row:
    <ul>
      <li>each sales person's ID, table sales, desk sales and chair sales</li>
      <li>the last row displays total table sales, total desk sales and total chair sales</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the commission table displays on each row:
    <ul>
      <li>each sales person's Id, table commission, desk commission and chair commission</li>
      <li>the last row displays total table commission, total desk commission and total chair commission</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

## Thoughts/Comments: 
Main takeaway - Lists, .append, displaying data using a for loop.
